# CADAgent

Transform 3D modeling from complex menus to simple conversations. Create and modify CAD models using plain English descriptions.

## What it does

Turn plain English into 3D models:

- "Create a mounting bracket with two holes"
- "Make a perforated tray, 30cm long with 20 holes"  
- "Build a sphere inside a cubic frame"

Models generate directly in Fusion 360.

## How it works

CADAgent connects natural language processing with Fusion 360's modeling engine. Describe what you want to build, and the AI interprets your requirements into precise CAD operations.

The add-in provides a chat interface within Fusion 360 where you can:
- Describe parts in plain English
- Iterate on designs through conversation
- Generate parametric models that update automatically
- Export standard CAD formats

## Requirements

- Fusion 360 (version 2.0.16000 or newer)
- Windows or macOS
- Internet connection for AI processing
- API key for CADAgent backend service

## Installation

See installation_guide.md for detailed setup instructions.

## Usage

1. Open Fusion 360
2. Launch CADAgent from the Add-Ins panel
3. Type your part description in the chat interface
4. Review and refine the generated model
5. Save or export your design

## Examples

**Basic shapes:**
"Create a 50mm cube with rounded corners"

**Functional parts:**
"Design a phone stand with 15-degree angle and cable slot"

**Assemblies:**
"Build a simple hinge with two parts and mounting holes"

## Support

For installation issues, check the installation guide. For modeling questions, describe your requirements as specifically as possible - the AI works best with clear, detailed descriptions.
